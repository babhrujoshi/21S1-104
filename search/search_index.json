These applications are primarily drawn from commerce, economics, and the social sciences. This is the main site for MATH 104 and is the source of all central course information, including the course outline, course learning goals, course policies, course study materials. The canvas site will be used for additional informations such as access to online homework, course grades and general announcements. Lectures and Workshops \u00b6 Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 1-3 pm, Location: Online Math 104 is presented as 4-5 hours of synchronous online lectures, which will be recorded and available on canvas, and 1-2 hours of workshops. Lectures will be held on Mondays 1-2 pm, Wednesdays 1-3 pm, and Fridays 1-2 pm. Workshops will be held after the lectures on Mondays and Fridays between 2-3 pm. In the workshops, students will work in small groups in breakout rooms, though there will be some time together as a whole group as well. Workshops are not recorded. The lectures, workshops, online materials, including the textbook and problem book, collectively provide students with the essential elements for learning differential calculus. There is no intent the lectures will cover everything in great detail, and students will need to integrate all of the learning materials through their on-going studies to build a deep level of understanding of the course material.

Some of these will happen during scheduled workshops. Weekly Webwork Assignments \u00b6 Each week there will be an online homework set. WebWork homework is due at 5:00 p.m. PT on Wednesdays. Late assignments are not accepted. Grading Scheme: \u00b6 Your grade normally will be computed based on the following formula: 40% Final Exam + 30% 5 quizzes + 20% WebWork Assignments + 10% Workshops plus other assignments. ( UPDATE ) There will be 5 quizzes instead of 4 and the quiz with the lowest grade will be dropped. Please note that grades may be scaled to ensure consistency with departmental expectations. FINAL EXAM PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: Students need to achieve a minimum of 35% on the final exam to pass MATH 104. Students who fail the course solely because they have failed to achieve the 35% minimum on the final exam will be assigned a final grade no higher than 45%. (This provision is rarely applied -- 1 or 2 students per 1000 are affected.) Passing the MATH 104 final exam may not be sufficient to ensure a student passes MATH 104 if they have failed the term work. CALL BACKS for ASSESSMENTS: We will use random call backs of students after the end of testing assessment (e.g. quizzes, final exam). After an assessment is completed, a random set of students will be contacted to discuss their submitted material during a Zoom call. Receiving a call is NOT a sign we believe a student has committed academic misconduct, and the material discussed will typically be solutions that are substantially complete. Course Policies: \u00b6 No unauthorized devices will be allowed at the final examination. This includes cell phones, smart phones, music players, and all other such devices. Formula sheets and other memory aids will not be allowed. Students may not access any information on their computers or online during the final exam. No calculators will be allowed on quizzes or the final examination. Quizzes: There will be 5 quizzes in MATH 104 . Students will write the quizzes on Thursdays between 1-2 pm. Quizzes will starts from 05/20. Missing quizzes: There are no make-up quizzes in this course. Missing a quiz for a valid reason normally results in the weight of that quiz being transferred to the final exam. Example of a valid reason is illness (students are not required to report detailed medical information). An example of a reason that is not valid is a conflict with work schedules. Any student who misses the midterm is to present to their instructor the Department of Mathematics self-declaration form for reporting a missed assessment to their instructor within 72 hours of the midterm date. This policy conforms with the UBC Vancouver Senate's Academic Concession policy V-135. Please note that a student who misses significant number of quizzes and has otherwise not completed a substantial portion of the term work normally shall not be admitted to the final examination. Workshop attendance: Students are expected to attend the scheduled workshop. Students who do not complete the work associated with these workshops will be judged to have not completed their term work. If a student needs to miss a workshop, follow the same procedure as for missing a midterm. Policy V-135 applies. Missing the Final Exam: You will need to present your situation to the Dean's Office of your Faculty to be considered for a deferred exam. See the Calendar for detailed regulations . Your performance in a course up to the exam is taken into consideration in granting a deferred exam status (e.g. failing badly generally means you will not be granted a deferred exam). In Mathematics, generally students sit the next available exam for the course they are taking, which could be several months after the original exam was scheduled.","title":"Grades"},{"location":"grades/#grades-and-policies","text":"","title":"Grades and policies"},{"location":"grades/#learning-assessment","text":"Students will be assessed using online homework, quizzes, and a final exam.

UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances.
