Scheme 1 \u00b6 participation : 10% assignments (6): 30% midterm exam: 30% final exam: 30% Scheme 2 \u00b6 assignments (6): 30% midterm exam: 30% final exam: 40% Collaboration \u00b6 Most homeworks involve programming tasks. You may collaborate and consult with other students in the course, but you must hand in your own assignments and your own code. If you have collaborated or consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult with your instructor or visit the departmental webpage on Collaboration and Plagiarism . Late submissions \u00b6 Each student has a three lecture-day allowance to use throughout the term. For instance, if an assignment is due by Wednesday, then submission by Friday counts as one delay; a submission by Monday counts as two delays; a submission by the following Wednesday counts as three delays (and consumes the entire three-day allowance). Apart from using delays, late submissions are not accepted. Once a solution set has been posted, no more late submissions are permitted; consequently, you may not always be able to use all of your delays. Policies \u00b6 No makeup exam for the midterm or final. If you missed the midterm exam you must document a justification. Midterm exam grade will not be counted if it is lower than your final exam grade. To pass the course you must do the assigned coursework, write the midterm and final exams, pass the final exam, and obtain an overall pass average according to the grading scheme. The instructors reserve the right to modify the grading scheme at any time.","title":"Grades"},{"location":"grades/#grades-and-policies","text":"","title":"Grades and policies"},{"location":"grades/#grade-distribution","text":"The grading scheme that gives the highest individual grade will be used to determine your course grade.","title":"Grade distribution"},{"location":"grades/#scheme-1","text":"participation : 10% assignments (6): 30% midterm exam: 30% final exam: 30%","title":"Scheme 1"},{"location":"grades/#scheme-2","text":"assignments (6): 30% midterm exam: 30% final exam: 40%","title":"Scheme 2"},{"location":"grades/#collaboration","text":"Most homeworks involve programming tasks.
